# Run a demo in an advanced way
This guidline will lead you know more about how to work with Object-detection API, including how to bring in the specific dataset,and how to configure the pipeline.
## Prepare your dataset
There are several data sets available online. You can download one of them from the website.
1. [Oxford-IIIT Pets ](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) (Recommeded)
2. [Open Images Dataset V3](https://github.com/openimages/dataset#download-the-data)
3. [MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home)
4. [ILSVRC](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/)

Or, you can create your own dataset.If you are using Mac OS X, you can use RectLabel.
An image annotation tool to label images for bounding box object detection and segmentation.
https://rectlabel.com

There are services like CrowdFlower, CrowdAI or Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk that offer data labeling services.
## Convert the dataset into TF records
In this step, you must read the . It's will be much easier if you have [this code](../Samples/create_pet_tf_record.py) as reference. By the way, you should split the whole dataset into two parts,one for training the other for testing/validation.
## Configure the pipline
You can choose a model from the model zoo or define your own model architecture
#### a)  Define a model
load a pre-trained model from a check point
seems wrong when I read the source code of export_inference_graph.py
you need to generate a .ckpt file from the model files first.
``` consel
python object_detection/export_inference_graph.py \
    --input_type image_tensor \
    --pipeline_config_path ${PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH} \
    --trained_checkpoint_prefix ${TRAIN_PATH} \
    --output_directory output_inference_graph.pb
```
Finetune checkpoint can point to a single model.ckpt file OR refer to a to a set of three files (.data-00000-of-00001, .index, .meta).

There's nothing wrong with your downloaded checkpoint files. Just use model.ckpt and replace "???" with the directory that contains the files.	  
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/2173   
if your OS is windows, make sure use \\\ as the dir separater.   
just as:    
fine_tune_checkpoint: "H:\\\Dataset\\\modelzoo\\\test\\model.ckpt"

### 2) configure the pipline


## 4. Train the model
use the API to train the model.  
```
python object_detection\train.py --logtostderr --pipeline_config_path=C:\Users\m192500\Documents\GitHub\PetDetection\config\faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_pets.config --train_dir=H:\DataOutput\Oxford-IIITPet\checkpt
```
## 5. Inspect the job
Progress for training and eval jobs can be inspected using Tensorboard. If using the recommended directory structure, Tensorboard can be run using the following command:   
```
tensorboard --logdir=$\{PATH_TO_MODEL_DIRECTORY}    
```
where $\{PATH_TO_MODEL_DIRECTORY\} points to the directory that contains the train and eval directories. Please note it may take Tensorboard a couple minutes to populate with data.
## 6. Testing/Evaluation
Evaluation is run as a separate job. The eval job will periodically poll the train directory for new checkpoints and evaluate them on a test dataset. The job can be run using the following command:   
```
python object_detection/eval.py \
    --logtostderr \
    --pipeline_config_path=$\{PATH_TO_YOUR_PIPELINE_CONFIG} \
    --checkpoint_dir=$\{PATH_TO_TRAIN_DIR} \
    --eval_dir=$\{PATH_TO_EVAL_DIR}   
```
where ${PATH_TO_YOUR_PIPELINE_CONFIG} points to the pipeline config, ${PATH_TO_TRAIN_DIR} points to the directory in which training checkpoints were saved (same as the training job) and ${PATH_TO_EVAL_DIR} points to the directory in which evaluation events will be saved. As with the training job, the eval job run until terminated by default.
