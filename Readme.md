This tutorial is summarized by myself with some webpages as references. I beleive it will guide you step-by-step to familar with the [object-detection project](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), and use the API to construct your own target detection model.

You can follow this main trail to make the learning more easily.
1. Roughly go through the main page of [object-detection project](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), and clone the project into your computer.
2. Install dependent packges and the object-detection API. Here is my <a href='docs/installation.md'>guidline</a>. I just add some notes and made some slight changes from the [offical page](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md).
3. If you pass the testing of the installation on the last step, you can try <a href='docs/installation.md'>a quick start demo</a> in Jupyter Notebook. Quickly go though this demo, don't stuck into the details of the code.
4. Then you should learn how to run the demo in <a href='docs/rundemo_advanced.md'>an ADVANCED way</a>. The most important thing is figure out how to bring in the specific dataset,and how to configure the pipeline. You don't need to worry about the performance of the model in this step.
5. Model evaluation and performanc improving.
